# Console Art

This is a fun art project in F# which expresses art through the console. In it I use different mathematical concepts from the polar graphing system, and I plan to add more and more as I go along. I am enjoying learning F#, and this project is helping me solidify my knowledge and understanding of F# to a greater degree.
